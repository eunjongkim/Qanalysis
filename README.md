# Qanalysis

`Qanalysis` contains useful routine data analysis tools for superconducting qubit measurement.
The package consists of two modules, `frequency_domain` and `time_domain`, which provides useful fitting libraries for spectroscopy and dynamics measurement data.

## Installation
The `Qanalysis` uses `lmfit` package for fitting and optimization. To install `lmfit`, run following command:
```
$pip install lmfit
```

After this installation, move to the directory of `Qanalysis` (can be copied to local directory by `$git clone https://github.com/eunjongkim/Qanalysis`) and run:
```
$python setup.py install
```

### Optional
To perform an advanded confidence interval estimation provided by `lmfit` you also need to install `numdifftools` (optional)
```
$pip install numdifftools
```
